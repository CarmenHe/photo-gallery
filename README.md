# About
One of my first web development projects, this is a practice in CSS and basic principles of design. It is written using just HTML and CSS, and was originally created on [replit](https://photogallery.che0908.repl.co/).

## Inspiration & Process
I was inspired by a disco-retro aesthetic, with a focus on accessibility and creating a pleasant visual experience with color and spacing for viewers.
Wireframing was done by hand; I incorporated the Law of Proximity and Enclosure.
Then, I selected and organized quotes and free images that matched the effect I wanted.
For my color palette, I wanted pastel and thus contrast, but still visually appealing. I used canva to help me find the hex codes I wanted.
Finally I put everything together using first the HTML, than formatting everything in CSS with flexbox and adding color.
